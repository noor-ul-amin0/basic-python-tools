# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects organized by difficulty level. Each project demonstrates different Python programming concepts and techniques.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three difficulty levels:

1. **Easy Assignment** - Basic Python concepts and simple functions
2. **Medium Assignment** - Intermediate Python concepts and more complex applications
3. **Hard Assignment** - Advanced concepts and a full application (Hangman Game)

## Easy Assignment

The easy assignment covers fundamental Python concepts:

- Basic calculator operations
- Temperature conversion
- Counting vowels in strings
- List operations (sum, average, maximum, reverse)

[View Easy Assignment Details](./easy-assignment/README.md)

## Medium Assignment

The medium assignment covers more advanced topics:

- Generating Fibonacci sequences
- Word frequency counting from files
- Data validation
- File handling with CSV files
- Creating an address book with persistent storage

[View Medium Assignment Details](./medium-assignment/README.md)

## Hard Assignment

The hard assignment is a complete implementation of the classic Hangman game:

- Word selection from different categories
- Interactive console-based UI
- Game state management
- ASCII art visualization

## How to Run

Each assignment folder contains its own `main.py` file that demonstrates the features:

```bash
# Run the easy assignment
cd easy-assignment
python main.py

# Run the medium assignment
cd ../medium-assignment
python main.py

# Run the hard assignment
cd ../hard-assignment
python main.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- No external dependencies
